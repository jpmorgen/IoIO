[Make a separate software development notebook so my observing
notebook doesn't get mucked up by this stuff]

Wed May  3 01:20:10 2017  jpmorgen@snipe

OK, now that I have Jupiter's center, how do I want to handle it in
real time?  That depends on what is available in the maxim object
namespace.

CCDCamera.ImageArray safearray of Long of size NumX * NumY
containing the values from the last exposure  BINGO!
I need Maxim on puppy.

CCDCamera.GuiderArray analogous for guider

Ah! There are some events that we can monitor, so we can potentially
run in parallel, saving the trouble of loading all of the Python
packages I depend on

CCDCamera.GuiderMoveStar moves the guide star _while tracking_ which
is exactly what I want! (delta move)

CCDCamera.GuiderXStarPosition plus CCDCamera.GuiderXError,
CCDCamera.GuiderYError tell exact position of the guide object


CCDCamera.SetFITSKey ( Key, Value )  Cool!  So I can record FITS
stuff in the raw files!  GetFITSKey returns a key, but you can't
seem to get the whole FITS header

CCDCamera.StartSequence HEY!  So I can do a hybrid interaction,
where I use my existing sequences

CCDCamera.PinPointStatus, ImageScale, PositionAngle, CenterDEC, and
CenterRA get at the Pintpoint stuff, but there seems to be no way to
get the info stored about the scope like the focal length, so this
is stuff we will have to store long-term.

So I envision having MaxIm running and the Python scripts
controlling it.  Lets see if we can really do this

Wed May  3 23:06:14 2017  jpmorgen@snipe

So I can do what I want with CCDCamera.GuiderMoveStar, but I have to
be the one in control of that.  So I need some sort of loop that
updates it periodically.  That would be a good thing to have be an
object, with the property of that object the rate I want, which can
be adjusted by other parts of the module that have that object.
There could be another object that keeps track of the guide scope
flexure...  Hmmm.  My original idea was to keep track of all motion
under the assumption that restarts of the guider picked up just
where the unguided scope motion left off.  I am finding that is not
the case: Jupiter can move around quite a bit when the guider
starts, so I will probably have to start fresh on motion
calculations if I really need to do a reposition.  But while I am
guiding, the motion should be relatively consistent.  So my original
idea was to have a model which set the starting rates.  I guess if
there is a deviation of Jupiter from where I want it, I want to
tweak the value used to move the guide box, but the model can still
do its thing.

Taking a step back, the guide box will have a certain trajectory
which will keep Jupiter perfectly centered.  What we really have is
a trajectory on the main camera and a separate one on the guider,
with the one on the main camera informing the one on the guider.

Trajectory is a listing of:
time, gx, gy, mx, my

We know the plate scales and orientations
(e.g. CCDCamera.GuiderAngle) of the respective cameras, so we can
use that to measure the real offset between the guider and main
scope, whether or not Jupiter is centered.

But fundamentally what we care about is putting Jupiter where we
want it and zeroing its motion.  In offset_guide.py, guide_calc did
the simple delta between adjacent points to calculate new rates.  Ah
HA.  In our move object, we could have space for the model and a
separate space for the measured.  In general, I might want an array
so arbitrary terms can be added, like for guiding on a star for a
faint non-siderial object.  So there could be some sort of a
registration process for the objects that send info to the guide box
moving object

OK, I think I have a good concept of a general guide box moving
object.  The next step is when the telescope takes an image, there
needs to be an analysis that tells us where the object is and where
we want to put it.  That analysis needs to happen in, or at least be
provided to a module that figures out how to tweak the measured
portion of the move object.  That is the module I have been
struggling with thinking about.  If we use the same registration
idea for that, the object finder/center calculators can be easily
added after-the-fact.  The module that does the calculation of the
offset rates that counteract the measured motion and delta from
desired position can then be developed independent of source of
information.

So I now am thinking about a module that uses the measured and
desired positions as a function of time and calculates the
correction rates to feed to the guide box moving object.  This is
where the trajectory concept comes in.  This module accepts a
function that feeds it the input values.  This measurement module
could use CCDCamera_Notify(ceSequenceCompleted)

So the measurement master module, or whatever I want to call it,
would handle all of the interface with MaxIm.  Hmm.  I am finding
that I might want the FITS header, but that does not seem possible.
I can, however, get one card at a time if I know what I am looking
for.  So the MMM could accept a list of FITS keys (e.g. FILTER,
DATE-OBS, etc.) which it would query when a new image is available.
It would pass the image and any desired FITS keys to the module that
does the measurement.  It could return None, if it declines to do a
measurement (wrong filter [might want to measure multiple quantities
like filters separately]).  But if it provides a measurement, the
MMM will process it.  Maybe different filters can be handled by
having different prefered centers....  And/or, it might be good to
have some sort of list of, e.g., filters, where each is only
compared to each other.  Say we do that, with a list of measurement
slots.  The MMM could calculate motions for each one separately.  If
they were "consistent enough," they could then be used by MMM to
derive the offsets.  

OK, so the MMM needs an algorithm for converting a series of
measurements to a rate for the guide box mover.  And here is where
we need the guide box mover to provide its trajectory.  Ultimately,
we just want to subtract our measurement trajectory from the
existing trajectory.  Not sure if we want to work in extrapolation
space or not.  Well, if the data are not slowly varying and
reaosnably consistent, then I am not going to be able to do anything
with them.  So applying that as a test criterion is something I
should do.

Thu May  4 15:59:26 2017  jpmorgen@snipe

OK, after some sleep, I realize that this is going to be some
background job that I am going to want a stop button for.  If I have
a stop button, I might as well have that also be a status display
panel.  Cool.  As far as measurement goes, because I can get the
absolute pixel that the object is on in both the guider and main
camera, I don't think it matters whether or not I have guided
between, just that I am guiding and the errors are reasonable when
the measurement is recorded

Wed May 10 12:31:46 2017  jpmorgen@snipe

On day schedule for concentrated effort on this.  Based on some code
I found at
http://wt5l.blogspot.com/2011/05/automated-astrophotography-with-python_28.html
I am going to make an object that contains stuff having to do with
MaxIm.  I am calling it MaxImData.  Maybe I should call the whole
package maximpy, where the offset guide component would be a
separate program to run for its event loop, but would import all the
code in maximpy.

I have some angst about whether or not maximdata or maximpy should
import numpy or just math.  Clearly I am going to need numpy to
identify Jupiter, etc., but for basic measurement, it will probably
not be needed.... No, I can't say that.  I might want to do some
pretty sophisticated estimation and fitting even if centers are
passed using guide stars or PinPoint.

Thu May 11 10:31:33 2017  jpmorgen@snipe

Got something up and running with MaxIm + now I need to get the
desired center stuff squared away.  At this point, I just want
something that works with the ND filter and a Y coordinate.  Since
the desired center moves, maybe I should call it measured center.
The routine is going to need an NDData and so does jupiter_center.
I think that it makes sense to have the NDData generated by the
desired center routine which is called first, but I can make the
logic so it can go either way.

Hmm.  Angst.  That is not clean and there isn't an easy way to get
values out into a parameter.  Things are expected to come out as
tuples.  But the function jupiter_center doesn't suggest it is
outputing the desired center, I just find it handy to do that.  I
suppose I could check on the receiving end for the second tuple/vector
and if it doesn't exist, assume center of image.

Thu May 11 11:30:13 2017  jpmorgen@snipe

OK, so jupiter_center turns into self.object_center in MaxImData.  But
it is more complicated than that.  I was thinking of having motion
calculated afer each exposure was recorded.  But it makes sense for
something else to trigger that, like a watchdog process monitoring the
events.  So I still need the intermediate level that I want to call
independently.

And I am also thinking that jupiter_center works for one image, but
ultimately I am going to want a more complicated function, like
ensemble_center that monitors the different filters, etc., and makes
decisions on whether or not to move things around.

Thu May 11 15:30:43 2017  jpmorgen@snipe

ACKK!  A hitch in my plans.  I am getting

com_error: (-2147352567, 'Exception occurred.', (65535, 'MaxIm DL 6', 'Image Not Available', None, 0, 0), None)

when I try to read an image with CCDCamera.ImageArray.
CCDCamera.ImageReady is true and the example off the next lets me
save, but it seems as though the approbation to not hand the array off
to vbscript and 

I might be able to get it through the Document object

http://www.newastro.com/tutorials/maxim_objects.html helped me with
that, but it is just from the documentation....

Ack!  What a pain.  It looks like I need to read things with
Document.GetFITSKey to get my own FITS header.  But at least I can do
it.

OK, so fundamentally I would like im to be a real astropy FITS im so I
could slog around in the FITS header at will.  To do that, I would
need to save things in an HDUlist

Fri May 12 08:54:59 2017  jpmorgen@snipe

OK, got the HDUlist thing to work, but the description of the image is
the transpose of what I want it to be.  im.shape reports X, Y as I
expect when I see the image in MaxIm and when it saves it to a FITS
file.  But when I make an HDU out of it, astropy reports the shape as
Y, X, presumably because it goes off the shape of the image assuming C
ordering.  Sigh.

There seems to be no tricky way out of this without transposition,
since the ordering of the bytes in memory are locked into the way
MaxIm sent them and Python received them.  If only a simple 1D array
had been sent, I would be fine.  At some level, that 1D array was
sent..  Let see if we can use flatten to see what it really looked
like.

BINGO!

I am reasonably happy with the solution and it checks out with
plt.imshow and the header

Now there is a problem with my approach, that the last image read in
is not necessarily the one that is going to have focus, if someone is
playing around selecting images with MaxIM.  But the Document object
is the only place I can get at the FITS keys I need.

I guess if this is running in the background the way I envision, I
shouldn't worry too much about it, because as soon as an event
happens, control is passed to the code querying the event, preventing
anything else from happening.

--> I am thinking that it might be a good idea to always have my
    coordinates transposed.  This is a pain, but it completes the job
    of transposing everything and results in things being able to plug
    right through in code.

Fri May 12 14:42:07 2017  jpmorgen@snipe

I want to be a little more clear about center pix vs center
astrometric coord.  I also now see that I can get guider images to
work with too, since I am forced to go through the Document object.

--> The watchdog should just retrieve the FITS keys to see if
    additional code should be triggered.  This saves transferring the
    whole image

Wed May 17 13:30:27 2017  jpmorgen@byted

On the way to the 'scope.

At this point I think it makes sense to subsume the maximdata
development into ioio.py so it is easier to just cut-paste

Wed May 17 17:39:05 2017  jpmorgen@byted

--> Wondering what the Pythonic way to deal with unexpected results
    is.  For now returning None seems to work pretty well.

Revisiting NDData now that I have had a little more experience with
classes.  Since I am going to slog around HDULists, I can define a
FITS key that has the ND prameters + check for that early on.

Wed May 17 19:55:20 2017  jpmorgen@byted

Cool!  I got things in the NDData object to work the way I want!  The
object stores things in the FITS header, which can bubble through
jupiter_center (or whatever I want to call it) without jupiter_center
having to worry about it.  If the MaxIm stuff works the way I think, I
can potentially write those keys back into the header before it
writes, though I may wish to let them be recalculated by reduction,
assuming it is important and needs to be rewritten

--> I want to use add_history from west_aux.py.  This highlights the
    necessity of figuring out the PYTHONPATH stuff on Windows/anaconda

Hmm.  I am running into the problem of tuple of tuple return from
jupiter_center.  It is not working the way I want.  The fundamental
problem is that I am returning TMI.  Or I am returning the I in the
wrong form.  Maybe I need to return an object that when queried, gives
the desired center, etc.

Hmm.  That is a good idea!  So the object would be of a subclass of
GetObjectCenterPix.  That object would be instantiated with the
HDUList_im_or_fname construct and then queried for the center pix of
the object and the desired center.  That object can get more
complicated if it needs to, particularly with respect to keeping track
of the desired center

Sat May 27 19:32:39 2017 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

Think about what I want to call the object, because the method I want
is really oging to return the desired center + MaxImData.center_object
is going to move it there

So it is really going to be something like ImageHandler, or something
like that + have methods

.desired_center
.desired_rate?

Hmm.  So the ImageHandler object (or whatever I call it) is going to
accept the stream of images and make decisions about what to do with them.

I was hoping to avoid having everything centrally scripted, but the
focus stuff suggests I might need to do that.

But I still should try to keep abstraction layers sensible.  I have an
NDData object + probably should have a JupData object, or more
generally an ObjData object.

At least for JupData, I would have center and desired center

There is another set of stuff I need to keep track of for moving the
guide box.  I could potentially put that into the ObjData base class,
or have another class entirely for that

Thu Jun 01 21:24:28 2017 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

Well, going with ObjData/JupData for now.  At the moment they are
hollow, in the sense that are not instantiated with the image as
property.  The image does get written in to property, but it can
change.  I am not sure I like that.  Potentially better to have the
layered objects, where the ObjData exists for each image that is read
in and can be queried for its obj center and prefered center.  Then
there is a separate object that keeps track of all of those, perhaps
OffsetGuide or OffsetGuideData.

OK, so how is the ObjData going to be handled with MaxImData?  I guess
a better question to ask is: who should be in charge?  The MaxImData
is going to be there connected to MaxIm.  The ObjData objects get
instantiated when an image is taken.  MaxImData might have the code
for that, but I don't think it is the right thing to be in charge of
that.  In other words, a separate application has the event-driven
logic.  Similarly, I think that I should keep the ObjData stuff out of
MaxImData, since it is just too individualized.  Rather, the ObjData,
or whatever subclass thereof should be driven by yet a third thing for
now.

Fri Jun 02 00:35:04 2017 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

Ack.  I have to actually select the window for it to be the active one.

So next step is to read in an image

Fri Jun 02 10:36:49 2017 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

Well, wait a minute.  I need to go back to the NDData logic since I am
using images of different size and binning.

So I want some property for the subimage and binning.  The
default_nd_pos and other nd position parameters should read in binning
= 1.

--> Either that or I just limit myself to binning = 1 cases for now

In any case, I need to make sure I check for out-of-bounds

Fri Jun 02 11:16:57 2017 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

Now ready to read in an IPT image!

The acid test is to just read one in and have that be the active Document

It worked!

Revisited desire to just have math in MaxImData section and find that
since I am dealing with the astropy FITS stuff, I need to have
np.ndarrays, so np is necessary for MaxImdata

So now I want to see if I can make a script out of it that I can run
from the command line or with MaxIm!

Fri Jun 02 14:22:09 2017 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

Apparently there is a thing called conda.

Ah.  Conda is like pip3 as a package manager.  It also creates
environments

python at the command prompt does bring up python

Type hello_argv.py + get the option to make a file association.  Took
a while to find python.exe, but now it is there (on puppy)

Hmm

Fri Jun 02 22:42:32 2017 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

Got ioio.py to work on IoIO1U1! At least during twilight with old
images.

--> I need to get the default position of the current ND filter

ND=NDData('//snipe/data/io/IoIO/raw/2017-05-29/Sky_Flat-0001_Na_off-band.fit')
print(ND.get_params())

Sat Jun 03 15:27:29 2017 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

<sigh> that is not as easy as I would like it to be.  Plus I need to
deal with binning stuff too.  So think about that for awhile.

I have been trying to keep NDData as a separate object.  I am seeing
there isn't much need for that.  As long as I don't call
get_obj_center on a flat, I am OK + I can potentially do some
safeguards against that. 

I am thinking a little more generally about the JupData.  Yes, I want
to use that to work with Jupiter, but I am also working with other
observations, like stars for focus and maybe other things.

So I am thinking that maybe ObjData should be ObsData, data about an
observation.  And I could have CorObsData for a coronagraph observation 

Wed Jun 07 10:28:03 2017 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

Tried to work at town office + date was messed up on byted, so work
was lost.  Decided to put NDData into CorObsData.  Just need to add
nd_ to a couple of its methods + move some of the ingest_im stuff into
the base init and CorObsData init methods.

Sun Jun 11 13:39:06 2017 CEST  jpmorgen@byted

<sigh> now that the ND filter is tipped, the ND edge finding algorithm
doesn't work as well.  At least with the flats, I can use small
vertical binning and that fixes the problem for them.  Maybe for the
Jupiter images, I can rotate 

Sat Jul 01 23:34:03 2017 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

Wonder if I can do the diagonal thing starting from the flats?

Tue Aug 01 19:17:30 2017 EDT  jpmorgen@byted

To do this effectively, I should make a decision when I am
processing the file if it is a flat or not.  I have IMAGETYP in the
list of required_FITS_keys, so it should come over fine in real time.

It would nice to have a place where I store the current paramters.  A
well-organized disk file is the right place.  That would be at the top
level of the raw data directory.  In the short term, it would be nice
to have that number in the property stashed from a previous flat run.

Well, that can just be a CorObsData on a flat!  That can be an
optional input.  Actuality the way to do that is just with a file name
and have CorObsData do it itself.

Hey, if I make the reference_flat a variable that is global to all
CorObsData types, I can at least for one session do what I am thinking of

Tue Nov 14 15:36:20 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Time to start thinking of getting this up and running, since I am 2
months out from deployment

Tried to send buffer to python:

I might need to get anaconda for snipe.  It looks like the latest
version of python is 3.6, but snipe only supports 3.5.

Since I use anaconda on puppy and IoIO1U1, it might be prudent to
install it on snipe....

OTOH, it looks like I can get scipy easily:

OK, I think that means I have things under apt package management 

So numpy is installed and is at 1.12.1, as suggested by pip.

I have python3-astropy installed already.  Get python3-scipy

ioio.py now works!

But I need to implement the shifted row algorithm.

. Center of image = 0 shift
. dy * tan(angle) = dx, round that
. X + dx = corrected X.  Maybe shift row by -(X + dx)
. collapse shifted rows to increase signal

Sun Nov 26 17:01:28 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Reading through ioio.py and finding some things are confusing and left
over from previous iterations.

I like the ObsData and CorObsData inheritance construct.  CorObsData
replaces NDData.  "params" is not too illuminating a name.  ND_coords,
ND_edges, and ND_angle are more sensible.  ND_params might be better,
but I don't know if it is worth changing it for that

And I wanted to figure out a good place to store a file with the ND_params

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7374748/whats-the-difference-between-a-python-property-and-attribute

Ah Ha!  I might want to define some methods __get__, __set__ and/or
__delete__ in some sort of ND_params object, so that when I call
something like print(flat.ND_params), it automatically does the
__get__ method

That is a refinement.  For now, I need to work at making it implement
the tilted algorithm.

The tilted algorithm depends on what I currently call the
default_nd_pos system, but which I think I would like to improve.

In the absence of any recorded previous ND_params and because I used a
variety of angles, 0 or 21 degrees is probably the best to start
with.  Alternately, I hard-code in ones for date ranges

It think it will be important to have a written area for this

Sun Nov 26 18:48:50 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

ypt, ypts, etc. may need to change.

Having trouble with inheritance

ObsData.read_im does FITS stuff, but not y_center.  That is why I want
to override it in CorObsData.  But when I try to use the version of
read_im in CorObsData, I get passed the name...

Ahh.  The problem seems to be growing pains between old-style
functions that I am used to and doing things more with objects.  I was
not storing the image from read_im into self!

 [  1.09770298e+03   1.29057039e+03]]
0.57199207656

That is pretty crummy!

SII with new way:

 [  1.15190956e+03   1.27540733e+03]]
0.698846271587

Not good.  Of course, I am a little off in the initial
default_ND_params, but I still want to be able to get close.

It might be that I have to just remove stars and cosmic rays first,
so they don't mess up the signal from the edge.  Or I could try that
edge detection routine....

And now that I have a cheap and dirty way to rotate the images, I
might go back to the collapse vertical idea, since mostly I want to
just get the left-right

I am not doing a true rotation, but a shift, which is why Jupiter
looks so weird, as does the flatfield image.

OK, I think I can improve on the peak selection algorithm if I choose
peaks that are the right distance apart.   But before I do that, check
things in & re-check for flat performance

Ah Ha!  I should probably iterate when I do the point rejection
algorithm.  I do a second pass, but that is different, since lots are
missing from the first pass

I might do well to include weights.  Or not have absolute difference
but use stdev

Ah.  I can use weights in the subsequent iterations

Has a good discussion about how to handle errors and exceptions and
whether or not to return None vs a null object:

http://code.activestate.com/recipes/68205-null-object-design-pattern/

I'll have to think more about this as time goes on.

I think that I will not handle all possible errors, but just in case,
this is an interesting bit of code

            return None

OK, I am having trouble with the array being the wrong orientation for
my new way of fitting the lines.  When given two sets of lines points
polyfit made the first column the first line, the second column the
second line.  This is pythonic.  I did things row-by-row with

ND_params = np.asarray((ND_params0, ND_params1))

Hmm

SII =  CorObsData('/data/io/IoIO/raw/2017-05-28/Na_IPT-0035_SII_on-band.fit')
print(SII.get_ND_params())
print(SII.ND_angle())

Shows things aren't working all that well for the SII image....

I think this might benefit from the differences method

OK, that looks good, but the SII image needs help.  In particular, I
need to know when to start looking for peaks, since the cwt finds some
where there are none.

We are generally looking for [1312 1419]

OK, as I am doing the SII flat, I see that I can set an upper limit to
the spread in flat mode as just under 1/2 of the CCD width, though
that is definitely liberal + will likely have problems when close to
the edges.


Ah ha, the bounds can be the size of the SII filter for all the flats

Well, that ended up being worse.  But I can use the vertical size too

So there is some bowing, but that is probably because of the 2nd

bounds.  For now it looks like I don't need to get the flats precise,
just good enough to get the morph and bounds set

Thu Nov 30 16:37:01 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

OK, reading to clean up code.  Do I want to use the getter and setter?
The advantage of doing it that way is that the caller doesn't have to
know the internal workings.  They just ask for the property and it is
produced.  Disadvantage is that there may be some instances where it
is expedient to pass parameters to tweak the algorithm used to
generate it.  Although that is not necessarily wise, since one of the
whole points is that I calculate it once and then return the cached
value.  It is more set up to tweak the property or attribute, or
whatever they are called on instantiation or shortly thereafter,
before the first call to do the long calculations.

I should have a way to re-do the calculations on an existing file with
the NDPAR* keywords, since they might refine.  Or I could remove them
externally and go with that.

It could be that I do:

ND_params = property(get_ND_params, set_ND_params, fdel=None, 'ND_params characterize the coronagraph ND filter')

for both ND_params and default_ND_params.  Of course that brings up
the long-term storage issue for default_ND_params, but I will deal
with that later.

Thu Nov 30 20:57:08 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Learning about the property() decorators and their limitations.  The
setter really takes just one argument and can't be used like a
function call to recalculate.  I would have to say something like

Na.ND_params = 'recalc'

The alternative is Na.calc_ND_params()

Either way is fine.  Might as well enable both for now.

As far as ND_angle goes, it is probably safest to recalculate it when
needed, since it is cheap, but in general I would want some sort of
registration system that listed the things that needed to be
recalced.  For now, I can just put the calculation of the angle in 

--> The ND_coords, obj_center, etc. would need to be recalculated
    too.  I could have a flat that indicated for each of those
    components if recalc had happened.  All of this to avoid just
    discarding and restarting the object, which could be expensive
    with an open file, though I could possibly extract the HDUList

My primary use for this is for a live system, with one chance to get
it right.  It will move on to the next image.

This brings up the question of efficiency.  I was hoping I could have
this running all the time, but it looks like ACP wants to call it on a
per exposure basis.  I suppose I could have it be like one long
exposure....  but worry about that later.  The point is, I don't need
to be infinitely flexible here on this particular object.

Fri Dec 01 12:09:10 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

So go back to the ACP question.

It looks like AcquireImage() can completely replace what ACP does when
acquiring a single image.  ** it has to check for the need to flip **
Return True = differ to ACP, OK means user function presumably handled
acquisition and False is abort entire run.  That can handle all of the
filter motion, recentering, guiding, etc.  It could be that I have the
background helper process running & looking for images showing up in
MaxIm that have been initiated by this script.  But at the very least,
I can have this script do periodic centering on a per exposure basis

TargetStart() is also a possibility, but it is before AcquireImage()
and seems to be more for tweaking things you should probably have
tweaked in your observing plan.  TargetStart() could potentially help
redefine things based on moon position, but I might want to put all of
that logic into AcquireImage()

Aside: I still don't see anywhere where I can tweak focus, but that
might be something I can do in AqcuireImage()!
--> Want to make sure I can be tracking Jupiter properly

So if I just set up for one Jupiter AcquireImage(), I grab the
observatory for the whole of when Jupiter is up, make my own flip
decisions, autofocus, etc.  Then when I release, ACP can pick up on
whatever plan/Schedule is available.  Autofocus from there might not
be the greatest, but I could still have a general part of AcuireImage
for that.


--> Hey, on-the-fly exposure adjustment is possible with this!
http://forums.dc3.com/showthread.php?10314-Question-on-UserActions-or-similar&highlight=TargetStart

#tag can be saved in a global part of UserActions

#tag is available to AcquireImage() and Description field of ImageSet
 or Observation is available

--> I will have to dig deep into AcquireImage.js

Either that or I could just have every Nth time through my internal
AcquireImage() loop return True so that there is just a generic
picture of Jupiter recorded and scope flip, autofocus, etc. is handled
automatically

--> HEY WAIT A MINUTE!  There is an autofocus script!  No, that is
    just a shell around SUP.AutoFocus.  But if I tweak all of the
    calls to SUP.AutoFocus in AcquireImages.js to add a little bit to
    the target RA, I should be set.  I can do this in IoIO mode only

In any case, however I end up structuring the AcquireImage()

ret = SUP.UserActions.AcquireImage(Pl, Tc, Is, imgFile + ".fts");   // Call with full name

where Pl is the plan object, Tc is the telescope control object and Is
might be image set?  We would basically replace one image with many.

So my personal AcquireImage could check to see that the background
guiding process was running (if I use that) and then just bang away
and telling MaxIm to record images
--> might need to insert yield statements

Taking a step back... No, I don't think I want to use the default
AcquireImage because it does the whole tracking thing.  So even though
it gets me name logic.  Wait.  Does it?  Not sure.  Anyway it looks
like my original plan should work, with the background task looking
MaxIm and feeding it to my Python script.  If there is a fight going
on for MaxIm, I can just have my script exit (might need to learn how
to pass it messages) when I do the periodic ACP thing.  I mostly want
it running to avoid the long startup time (assuming there is one).

OK, so I should plan for occational starts to ioio.py, or whatever it
ends up being called.

So this means I am going to need a way to read in the
default_ND_params, or have them hard-coded.  It would be cushy to have
a way to write them within the object + read them back + I suppose I
could check for system names like I did for something else.

So all of this is leaning me away from a system that has the
complexity to re-process the innards

Looking into the fitsio stuff, it looks like I can extract the HDUList
object from a running ObsData and shove it into a new ObsData for
processing there.  So there is no need to do the reprocessing within &
there is possible motivation for having multiple objects storing the
results

OK, so if I open a file, keep it open, if I read a file from a
filename, close it

Mon Dec 04 14:17:23 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/986006/how-do-i-pass-a-variable-by-reference

arguments are passed by reference.  Once I rebind the reference
(physically set the parameter name to something else), it is separated
from the outer object.  But I can operate on the parameter name 

So the way I have read_im written, I assign the value of the argument
to something else, but I think that means the full object goes along
and I can mutate it

def try_to_change_list_contents(the_list):
    print('got', the_list)
    inner_list = the_list
    print('assigned to inner_list')
    inner_list.append('four')
    print('changed inner_list to', inner_list)

outer_list = ['one', 'two', 'three']

print('before, outer_list =', outer_list)
try_to_change_list_contents(outer_list)
print('after, outer_list =', outer_list)

Confirms that the inner name mutates the actual object

OK, so when I read_im an nd_array, if I were to del self.HDUList, I
would delete that original nd_array?  No, I think I would delete the
self.HDUList pointing to it, but the original nd_array would live.
No, only if something else is pointing to it.

I am planning to have a process monitor the MaxIm notify events and
grab the image then.  Whatever loop is doing that is going to call the
MaxImData.get_im and receive a tuple from MaxIm and shove that into an
NDarray that will eventually get into an ObsData.HDUList.  If the
MaxImData.get_im returns an HDUList into a loop variable, presumably
all past versions of that loop variable are not kept.  But if there
are objects that reference the NDarray(s), they will stay hogging
memory.  So the trick is to delete the objects referencing the NDarray.

Hmm.  Deleting obj.HDUList removes it from the namespace, which is
different than setting it to None.  Either one will deference and let
the memory free, but one is a little more gentle than the other.

If I really am using the ObjData to store data about the observation
and not the observation itself (which could be stored outside without
being deleted when I delete the HDUList inside), I should definitely
delete the HDUList, because there will be a hard error when I try to
improperly use the object.  The object is only for calculating,
storing and delivering the property of the obj_center and
desired_center and whatever else I may need (e.g. y_cent)

OK, I am now running into problems with the binned and unbinned
center.  I absolutely need unbinned to be able to do the re-centering
calculations.  I may want to 

Mon Dec 04 17:10:26 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

OK, now I am facing the binning issue.  It might be that I just need a
method that takes care of unbinned coordinate calculation.  Maybe
something like "unbinned."

Ah, then I could have another function that would be for binned.  That
might be motivation for having the center type property be methods
again, or I could just have a separate property.

To be clear I might need to have unbinned always referenced in my
calls.  Or have both so it is always clear

Not necessarily!  I can use ObsData.binned() to do the conversion!

As far as binned exposures for calc_ND_params, the best thing might be
to just rebin them.  Apparently I need to write my own code or get
some from a wheel.

Tue Dec 05 15:55:36 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

I think I can get the rebin code into ioio.py

Done!  Might be slow the way I do it rather than binning all the
calculations

That was cleared up with medfilt with a kernel size of 3.  Harder to
get rid of saturated moons.  On the moving_to, they are not saturated.

As I am moving on in this, I am wondering if the right thing to do is
let the files be written and handle the calculations off-line with
another program, since I am not sure they can happen quickly enough to
keep MaxIm happy.  It would be great if I could fork a child process
that takes the HDU and does its work while the primary process
returns.  But ultimately, I just need to know where Jupiter was at a
particular time and how to tweak the guider, if I am going that far.
If I am just setting things up, I have to wait for my process anyway,
reading a file might not be that much more time.

Well, I have the sorting stuff working, but it doesn't necessarily

Thu Dec 07 09:44:18 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Whew!  Found an error in rotating ND_params back.  Things look a bit
better now + check with reality in a very difficult case.

I am starting to think that the best place to put the
default_ND_params determination is where I call CorObsData, not in the
object itself.

OK, so I am facing the problem I had earlier, that to jump-start the
process the flats need different parameters than the objects.  DO I
want to deal with this inside the object or outside?

For now it is handy to do so inside.

Looking very nice

The next thing I want is a distance from the center of the ND filter

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_line

They prefer the parameterized form of the line

ax + by + c = 0

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Point-LineDistance2-Dimensional.html

Has

y = -a/b x - c/b

That is what I am looking for

m = -a/b
h = -c/b

where h is the intercept

b = -a/m = -c/h
c/a = h/m
h = mc/a

This is just chasing my tail.  Use 2-point form:

abs((x2 - x1) * (y1 - y0) - (x1 - x0) * (y2 - y1)) /
((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)**0.5

Got that working.  It was a problem with the X origin.

Now doing the long run and finding that, predictably, all dy valyes in
the desired_center are 0.  Nicely, the dx values are pretty darn small
too.

--> the variation in the obj_center is unexpectedly large

Fri Dec 08 12:48:05 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

--> first few exposures on 2017-05-28 might be having a problem with
    background being so bright -- my silliness of exposign during
    civil twilight

--> consider subtracting median of cropped image or use histogram
    technique to spot that background.

Where the top is the desired center difference between tries with
different y_steps and the bottom is the difference in the

the case where the background sky was very bright.

I think the ioio.py algorithm is shaping up pretty well.  Did a little
more streamlining and checked it in with an amendment.  I love git!

Now the big test is to see if I can find an off-ND filter image.

First of all, I can test some of my current logic with a flat

I think the way to do that is to do a walk and see if I can find any

so.  It is a separate utility that needs to be in the module and uses
CorObsData.  Hey!  It could be an object itself.  Hmm.  That is a
little awkward.  It is basically just an ndarray, so I am not sure I

While I am getting more things to look into on that front, start to
look into the MaxIM/ACP side of things.

Based on behavior noted in the logs, it looks like in order to use the
guider on a non-siderial object, I need to define a SUP.UserActions.
That apparently operates on that Count level.  But I don't want to be
launching a big Python script all the time, which is why the
invitation to replace a large section of AcquireImages.js.  It would
behoove me to copy as much of Bob's code as I can to get the basics
set up, but I did the Python because there is just way too much
sophistication for that to be done in .js.

/data/PSIScope/observing/AcquireImages.js line 1774 is where he starts
the autoguider.  I may opt to just do it with my own code, since I
think he checks lots of other thigns, though I could try it either
way.  It would get the error graphs onto the the website.

Either way, once the guider is started, the next most important thing
for my code to do is command MaxIm to take pictures and watch them
come in to get the obj_center and desired_center.  Those *_centers go
on a stack that helps move the guide box or stop the guider and
totally move the telescope.  I guess the later makes it clear that I
should probably not have ACP handle the guider.


Note AcquireImages.js line 1806 + things above that got orbTrackRealRates
                       if(orbTrackRealRates)
                            SUP.SetTrackOffset(Tc.RARate, Tc.DecRate);      // Complier assures scope can do tracking

Since he is doing those calculations, it might be nice to have a user .js
script do them.  But I think I should be able to have access to all of
those objects, just like in MaxIm, which is beyond way cool!

In any case, my script is going to be called when Jupiter is near the
center <see below for argument that I can do this one image at a time>

Check if need flip (see line 2941 of AcquireImages.js), --> add time
for first alignment if not guiding and/or tracking

If not guiding and/or tracking (first entry)
def center_loop
    Loop:
        Preliminary exposure (R-band)
        Check close enough
            break if so
        Move to expected center

    Start guider
    Loop:
        Preliminary exposure (R-band)
        Check if close enough
            break if so
    	if too far warn & recenter with loop above
        Move Jupiter with guide box (separate Loop)

    else:
        Take Requested filter image
	<Possibly with ImageEnd()>
        Process image with CorObsData
	Accumulate CorObsData
	If not too far off
	    Generate guide box rate + send to guide box mover section of code
	else:
	    warn
	    If way too far off:
	        Turn guider off & return OK to trigger loop to recenter
                and initialize guider
	    else:
	        Use Start Guider loop


Guide box mover
    Initialize when guider initialized -- remember initial guide box
    position
    
    Accept rates

    Independent Loop:
        Move guide box according to rates
	
    Fail if getting close to camera edge
    Fail if Jupiter fades
    --> Add script fail to shut down

The way Bob has it structured, AcquireImage() is designed for a single
image, but I don't see why it could't be a very long image.  It is
like going off and doing DAWNFLATS.

ret = SUP.UserActions.AcquireImage(Pl, Tc, Is, imgFile + ".fts");   // Call with full name

So the first thing I need to do is check to see if I can access the
Pl, Tc, etc. objects from Python.  I kind of doubt it.  But I can
write a .js that does the looping after preliminary set up in Python.
The Python event catcher can do the guiding thing.

http://solo.dc3.com/ar/RefDocs/HelpFiles/ACP81Help/scr-ovw.htm

Says that Python should have it

--> how are the user scripts interrupted by weather?  AcquireImages
    doesn't seem to handle weather, so maybe that is done somewhere
    else.

Worked fine

Thu Dec 14 09:11:32 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

At some point, I need to decide when to merge this stuff back to
IoIO.notebk.  For now continue thought here.

Camera not connected so I can't check, but I seem to recall that I did
exposures in 1-hour chunks.  Io's orbital period is 42.45930686
hours.  Sampling it during its ortbial period 10 times seems fine if
orbital period is all that is going on.  But since I am able to
resolve structure close to the moon which might be affected by the
torus, having more frequent sampling would make sense.  The torus ansa
itself changes on 15 minute time scales.  Changes at Io could be even
more frequent

1m Na off-band
5m Na on-band
9
5m [SII] on-band
1m [SII] off-band

For a total of about 60 minutes of observing time per cycle.  I could
have this be chopped up in a different way if I want.

Looking at logic in /data/PSIScope/observing/AcquireImages.js and find
that the AcquireImage user action continues back to the Count loop so all of
the logic below there is skipped, which includes messing with the
guider and it looks like tracking too.  So in my user action script, I
need to take care of all of that.  But to give me flexibility of
messing with exposures at the Scheduler level, I should probably have
my script just handle things one at a time after launching the Python
background job.

Ah, the code above the AcquireImage user action is not all that
extensive, but does include autofocus and reslew.  This means that
Jupiter might spontaneously end up in the wrong place sometimes if I
use the Count loop and the autofocus periodic or adaptive features.

The alternative is just using an hour-long (or however long)
"exposure" in scheduler and handle all of the exposure looping in
there.  Given that I want to, that sounds reasonable.  But think for a
miniute how it might work with the independent Python job.  Given that
it is only looking at the images as they are taken from MaxIm and has
no control over the initiation of the images, I don't see it working
to do guider stop, telescope move, reinitialize.  That has to be
handled by the code asking MaxIm to take an image.  But I would need
to have some code asking for the image anyway.

OK, so it looks like a question of overhead.  I could use the
individual image stream from ACP/Scheduler and do a pre-image every
time, which would be a waste, but would get me in line.  I could live
with up to a 5-minute exposure lost each hour after a focus.  That
might be more time lost to find itself.

Hey, there is a flag that gets set when the autofocus stuff is done.
That is what I was looking for!  It is AG (auto guider) and Orbital
Tracking

--> hmm.  Not sure I want to use his autoguiding stuff

This is how I would turn it on and off
SUP.AutoGuide(true);
SUP.AutoGuide(false);

This is how I test --> not sure which is best
SUP.Guiding
SUP.GuiderRunning

Other indication:
var orbTrackRealRates = (Tc.OrbTrack && (Tc.RARate !== 0 || Tc.DecRate !== 0));

This is how I would set it

if(orbTrackRealRates)
    SUP.SetTrackOffset(Tc.RARate, Tc.DecRate);      // Complier assures scope can do tracking

But not sure if that has the real test.

Anyway, I can get to that when I need to.  It definitly looks like my
first-level user action can use something like these to test to see if
it is the first time it has been entered and go through the necessary
logic loops above (search for Loop:)  Amend that

Hmm.  So where am I going to have my event loop for moving the guide
box?  That has been the hard thing.  I guess to start with I could
just skip that part and do periodic recenters when the distance gets
too large.  But what I really want is that process to be running in
the background to help MaxIm keep the object in the primary mirror
centered.

To do that I would need to learn how to launch a separate process and
pass messages to and from it.  At the most basic level, all those
messages need to be are the _rates_ in RA and DEC that I want to move
the guide box.  The process would then generate a string of the
appropriate MaxIm object commands to move the guide box.  It would
also need to have some way to know when it got to the edge

OK, back to the scheduler aspect.  I might be able to have the
Jupiter plan include a calibration star.  That would be where it gets
the right autofocus HFD.

Work in PSIScope.notebk on getting scheduler up and running for more
objects.

Sun Dec 17 15:22:07 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Ack!  Scheduler doesn't like the Foster Systems roof controller.
Sigh.

Anyway, I can get by with ACP until I resolve that issue.  Go back to
getting my Python code to run on Windows & with ACP or MaxIm or
however I do this. 

Ah, I remember why I wanted to have it running in the background: it
takes a long time to load all of the modules it needs.

This was a little complicated because I have Daniel's thing, but as
long as I put it in the same directory (as a link), it loaded OK.
First time I launched it, it took a minute.  Second time was more like
10s, but that extended back to 30s or so after another try.

Individual files in a process_dir take about 1s, as expected on a
slower computer.


https://www.pythonstudio.us/introduction-2/implementing-com-objects-in-python.html

Hey, it looks like I can create a python server!

import pythoncom

etc.  Whew!  It looks like I can get what I want in both directions.

If I end up using TakePicture to take the image, I might want to use
the ImageEnd() user action.  Or I can just do everything myself in
AcquireImage, which might be a little cleaner

want.  I think that is what the pytonstudio.us stuff is giving me in Python

Mon Dec 18 19:32:11 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

So at some point, I am going to want to separate the Windows-specific
stuff from the CorObsData stuff.  I am finding thanks to Daniel's work,
that as long as the import is in the same directory as the original
script, it works just fine.  Plus I could probably figure out how to
make it work other ways.

So to start off with, I want to enable the WSC components in ACP.  No,
actually, I think I want to make sure the simulator works OK first.
Oh, I already did that with simulate.txt plan.

OK, set up WSC JS version

Tue Dec 19 09:02:53 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Did a test object in ioio.py which shows that an object with a wait
loop is not an independent thing.

So I need to create an independent program for both the guide box
mover and the CorObsData component.

Along those lines, I need to start thinking about what to call the
components of the [Python] program that are going to be collecting the
CoObsData and calculating guide box rates.

--> Check to see if FITS headers are persistent, otherwise make a list
    of keys I want to extract and have be permanent

The guide box move code should be simple enough for a js program.
that program has to run continuously and accept events

But I don't know if I want to bother learning how to do that, since I
am going to need to learn how to make one in Python anyway for the

I am sensing that I can make ioio.py have some arguments to main that
launch the various servers/clients that I want.  Otherwise, I just
import it and use the objects for reductions (or reductions will be
other arguments to main)

I have a MaxImData class definition that I will need in my guide box
mover, but the mover itself should not be in the cclass definition: it
instantiates a class member.

I wonder if I could have everything in one event loop, so the guide
box mover doesn't have to be a separate thing + can share property.
That seems to keep things a little more simple.  But I could
potentially split them out within the module if I need to.

OK, so what to call this.  We are making a server for precision
centering and dealing with differential flexure.  The fact that
Jupiter is involved is secondary

So there is basically one entry point: precision_center

Back to the guider loop.  I don't see how I can get around the fact
that I need a background process.  Looking into sched event
scheduler.  Still seems to block or need to be re-called.

Circuits is an event driven module

--> It may be that the server allows the loop to go on independent of
    other calls!  That would mean I would use the COM service to
    connect to my own server!
    
Tue Dec 19 14:47:06 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Hmm.  Doing some simple tests with HelloCom and HelloClient and find
that the COM object is instantiated on a per-client basis.  In other
words, dispatching the server starts its own instantiation of it.  I
have a feeling that what I am asking it to do is rather complex....

It might be that I can instantiate an object and store it as a global
variable in the place Bob gives me.

Looking into asyncio

Looking into ASCOM driver video https://youtu.be/XVlrDyIBd5I further
and find that the persistent state is maintained via the arduino board
not in the object.

Looking more at
http://timgolden.me.uk/pywin32-docs/html/com/win32com/HTML/QuickStartServerCom.html

_com_interfaces_

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686618(v=vs.85).aspx

Ah Ha!  Persistent Object Interfaces

But there is not much by way of actual examples + it is not clear if
this is implemented in Python.

Fundamentally, if I have a process that I run separately that reads a
file with the rates, that would be sufficient.  The file could have a
control flag built in that would latch off when the MaxImDL guider
turns off.  It would work for me to do this in the ioio.py and have
the instantiation of it be a command line option.

Actually, the more politically correct way might be to have it serve
up COM object that does the interface!  Note that I have to run the
.py file once to register, but it is not clear if that goes across
boots

--> Check that object registration is persistent.  May be related to
    having MaxIm start once before all COM hooks are active and is
    likely so

--> Figure out where this goes possibly /cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/ACP Obs Control/Scripts/

OK, now that I think I know the limitations of the COM system, go back
to rethink the whole thing.

I basically want two things that are running all the time, or at least
persistent in memory.  The guide box mover is the one that has to
click continuously.  The rest of the code in ioio.py I just want to
sit there, ready to call.

I could make ioio.py an active X COM object with a set of exposed
methods for doing things that are called by AcquireImage.  If I make
the object a global variable, it is persistent as I want it.  I
probably wouldn't need too many exposed methods: append_obs

It would be Most Elegant if I could have guidebox_mover be an event
loop controlled within that object.

Ah. I see that what I really want is a coroutine, since that can go
along with yields

Maybe what I want is concurrent
https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Future

That still seems like the executors are separate processes.  The
coroutine has the example of being all one blob.  --> I could
potentially do it that way if I am not picky about how often the
GuideBoxMover gets called.  I just need to know it will be called
often enough

This just seems more trouble than it is worth

Really what I want is inter-process communication (IPC)
https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipc.html

mmap might be a way to keep this in memory

Wed Dec 20 10:20:47 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Looking into JSON and finding that I might be able to share a StringIO
object?  Maybe not.  I can't share objects across the processes

https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html

JSON produces str not bytes, so that might not be the best choice for
mmap.

mmap seems really primitive in that it needs the size of the file and
stuff like that.

Probably a good idea to start with the regular old file first

Hey, they give me the child process example I am looking for!  Well,
that is on an OS that I would rather be working on....

So back to a JSON written to a regular file read by the

But https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1196074/how-to-start-a-background-process-in-python

need to talk to it via a file

Thu Dec 21 17:36:16 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

ioio.calc_main_move is what I want when Iwant to center the object.  I
have something commented out called center_object that does that.
That would be a public method in my AcuireImage user action

--> I still need to write the thing that does the guide box rates.
    But those are looking like they will be a tuple or np.array in y,x order.

So CCDCamera.GuiderMoveStar is what I want to eventually plug into.
It can do fractional pixels, so I can do this as often as I want but
should limit bandwidth.

I like the idea of letting GuideBoxMover decide the rate at which it
will poll

Sun Dec 24 14:07:39 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

At some point I will want to add the complication of flexure.
Ideally that would be done as a separate process that looks at the
scope position, calulates the rate and feeds that to the GuideBoxCommander

Hmm.  On Windows, getting an error that a Python file is not a valid
Win32 applicaiton.

<sigh> because python defaults to python 2.7, I can't use the same
command on windows and Debian

I can consider doing an update alternatives on snipe....

Did that (see snipe.notebk) and things work more smoothly across
platforms

Now think about where I am going to put the centering command.  I have
the MaxImData object, which needs to be persistent for connecting
continuously to MaxIm.  So in that loop code, I need to instantiate it
and keep it around.

That suggests that I need to make a controller object

ObsData, MaxImData.  ObsControl?  PrecisionCenter?  PrecisionGuide?
ObsGuide?

This one object is going to have property that keeps track of the
accumulation of ObsData and has methods to control the initial
centering and guide box mover.

Sun Dec 24 20:13:20 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

OK, I have written PrecisionGuide.center.  How can I test it?

P = PrecisionGuide() # defaults should be good
P.center('//snipe/data/io/IoIO/raw/2017-05-28/Na_IPT-0007_Na_off-band.fit')

After a bit of struggle, seems to have worked!  At least in info message

Now that connects to MaxIm's telescope and I think I got it to work on
the real thing before.

One thing I could potentially do is just record a pre-image in R
before every image and do a move & then return "true" to move on.

Mon Dec 25 17:23:29 2017 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

So if PrecisionGuide.center doesn't have an input, maybe I should have
it take one!

So that means I am going to need to learn how to record images with
MaxIm.  And handle the filters.

Fri Dec 29 14:03:11 2017 EST  jpmorgen@byted

It looks like I don't have Python for the laptop?  No, I do, but
somehow .py files are not associated.

Sat Dec 30 14:05:53 2017 EST  jpmorgen@byted

Got python properly registered on the laptop.  Really slow to bring
MaxIm up and do P.center(), but it does seem to work!

OK, so now I think I might be ready to implement the loops above for
centering and guiding.  As I plan that, I also need to look at the ACP
side of things.

Sat Jan 06 16:40:07 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Put that as a note in ioio.py.  Will need documentation

Need to work on

Integration with ACP UserActions <not on laptop>
Guide box rate calculation system
GuideBoxMover system

I have GuideBoxMover and GuideBoxCommander.  What is missing is
whatever takes the sequence of ObsDatas and analyses it to produce
GuideBoxCommands.  That could be GuideBoxCommander

Reading from def center_loop above and wondering if I should separate
some tasks or combine them.  start_guider looks like something I am
going to need to do.  Do I have it do a center_loop or should
I assume center_loop is done first?  I could have it do the center
loop and raise any errors itself.

Fri Jan 12 11:55:07 2018 EST  jpmorgen@byted

Thinking more about start guider.  Having it separate means I can do
what I want to position the object where I want it

there is a maxim CCDCamera.GuiderRunning property, but that only tells
if the guider is running already

CCDCamera.GuiderTrack ( Duration )

is what I want to turn it on, where duration is the exxposure time
(need to think about that)

but before I do that I need to set the position of the guide start

CCDCamera.GuiderAutoSelectStar [= Boolean]

Does that to the brightest star in the FOV.  I of course want that
for Jupiter and generally for sideral targets, but when I am going to
be doing non-sideral guiding, I am going to want to override, or
something like that to pick a star off to one side so it can move a bit

GuiderSetStarPosition is needed if this AutoSelect is False

The PrecisionGuide.acquire_image is going to need to take (all?) the
parameter that ACP shoves at it.

Or do I want one that just has regular parameters I can pass from a
script instead of ACP.  Maybe I need two, since I was thinking of
having one do ACP's take_image and one just do it by itself.

I think I can leave it to run-time, since Bob makes available the
Util, etc., objects.  I can pass them in, defaulting to None.  If they
are there, that could be a signal I want them to be used.

Fri Jan 12 16:20:17 2018 MST  jpmorgen@byted

Thiniking GuideBoxController might eventually be a separate process
that receives input from PrecisionGuide.GuideBoxAdjuster, which just
runs once per image, and separate processes of TrackRateAdjuster and
DifferentialFlexAdjuster.  GuideBoxController would have each of these
objects registered in it with file-oriented (or better) communications
which tweak the ultimate rate at which GuideBoxController commands
GuideBoxMover to move the guide box.

Hmm.  GuideBoxAdjuster could be its own object with the property of
the ObsDataList.  I could have one for each filter, but I was thinking
I would figure out how to combine them.  

Maybe it would make more sense to have the GuideBoxAdjuster make the
list of ObsDatas

Mon Jan 15 11:17:16 2018 MST  jpmorgen@byted

Tried to use at telescope!  Got as far as getting an ND_params from a
flat, but was too hard to get it into PrecisionGuide.center

--> Think about how to get ND_params into PrecisionGuide

Mon Jan 15 11:51:32 2018 MST  jpmorgen@byted

For a standard ObsData, PrecisionGuide.center is easy.  What I want is
some way to get parameters in by hand.  So rather than having the
ObsData class be a parameter, I should probably just have made a
subclass.

But really I just need arguments to the ObsData class.

What can **kwargs do for me?  It is a dictionary of keywords

OK, I think I implemented that.  But now how to pass that in from the
command line?  I might want to do a * after something like --ObsDataArgs

--> think about making an emulator of MaxImData for Linux

Hmm.  Not sure if the **kwargs is really going to work with argparse.
I basically need to just know what the arguments are going to be

OK, should now be able to do

ioio.py --ND_param_dir "C:\Users\PLANETARY SCIENCE\Desktop\IoIO\data\2018-01-16"

Mon Jan 15 20:10:30 2018 MST  jpmorgen@byted

Ack!  Passing **kwargs only works once.  Once the keywords have been
stuffed into a dictionary, they are a positional parameter [ah, I need
to pass them again as **kwargs, which puts them back into keyword
args]

--> ! script disconnects camera!

Fri Jan 19 08:08:11 2018 MST  jpmorgen@byted

So it looks like I need to do some work with the WCS keywords in order
to control guider slews properly

--> check to see where guider rate is set in APCC & if guider rates are
    different because of rectangular pixels in guider

--> I can do a sanity check with what it in MaxIm

--> guidebox move is going to need to know about rectangular pixels.
    Maybe guidebox move command should be expressed in arcsec


Indeed, I think having the WCS transformations from main camera pixels
to delta arcsec.  Guider move is going to be in delta arcsec which
needs to be translated into delta pix

--> should print be a function or a procedure?
--> a function

--> return is just a statement but can be a function

--> BASIC

So I have been struggling with what to do with all of the command line
parameters that would get added by people's different modules.
Fundamentally what needs to happen is that a bunch more
center_parser.add_argument calls need to be made.  So center_parser
could be an object that gets passed around to the modules that add to
it.  So there could be some registration system.  It could be part of
CorObsData, but it really doesn't fit there.  It would need a
component that would add to the center_parser and the general parser
too.  And to the cmd_center

Mon Jan 22 08:20:19 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

--> anti-stiction in DEC

Ack!  I think I have a bad pin point solution in the guider

--> get another guider plate solve

OK, PIERSIDE is what I want and not FLIPSTAT

I will want to have the MaxImData connect to the telescope itself,
since the MaxIm properties don't do all the work I need

FLIPSTAT should be '' or FLIP/MIRROR

In any case, for some reason it is not being used

--> I need to figure out what telescope object is being used

--> get guider rates

Guider rate is a setting on the Rate settings menu in APCC
http://www.ascom-standards.org/Help/Developer/html/P_ASCOM_DriverAccess_Telescope_GuideRateDeclination.htm

<sigh> so just like all ASCOM components, I have to separately specify
the equipment

AstroPhysicsV2.Telescope

Before I forget, tweak the run_level_default_ND_params

ioio.py ND_params '/data/io/IoIO/raw/2018-01-22'
    = [[  3.63686271e-01,   3.68675375e-01],
       [  1.28303305e+03,   1.39479846e+03]]

Now I would like to use that.  Difficult logic in the __init__.  I
think that I might have to use run_level_default_ND_params in the
invocation of 

Mon Jan 22 17:16:46 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

--> Hey, ACP doesn't like to have MaxIm connected to the telescope, so
    maybe I should avoid doing that too, if possible

So how invovled do I want to get with the MaxIm stuff for the
telescope?

Auto Scope Dec would presumably need the scope connected to MaxIm.
But ASCOM direct might sort of do that.

Looking at the behavior of MaxIm, unless I am connected to the
telescope, Auto Scope Dec and Auto Pier flip are grayed out + Pier
Flip is active

Bob has SUP.AutoGuide(true) to turn on his own autoguiding algorithm.
I suppose I could use that.  Ugg.  That means I need to determine if I
am in his stuff or not.  Alternately, I can connect and disconnect
MaxIm to the telescope when I get out of my stuff.

No, I could potentially keep disconnected from the scope in MaxIm and
copy all that in myself.....

So what is the best way to get run_level_default_ND_params?  That
happens in populate_obj, when we would have otherwise thown an error.

Tue Jan 23 11:22:08 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

SideOfPier

<Sigh> I am not sure if pierEast pierWest is going to give me what I
need.  But looking at the PinPoint solutions, I see the CDELT* are
_both_ of opposite sign on pier flip.  Ah.  The trick is that the RA
axis goes in the opposite direction!

 a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
 a[:,::-1]
array([[2, 1],
       [4, 3]])

Hey, I can use Ellipsis, or ... to skip to the last index, which helps
ensure program works if just one tuple is given

 a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
 a[...,::-1]

Wed Jan 24 07:57:05 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

OK, so I may want to rename guider_move in MaxImData

Looking at ASCOM standard to see if there is a matching name, no, I
did it with guider_move, since that matched MaxIm!

http://www.ascom-standards.org/Help/Developer/html/P_ASCOM_DriverAccess_Telescope_GuideRateDeclination.htm

PIERSIDE =EAST/WESTin hdr
SideOfPier =pierEast pierWest in ASCOM

So guider_move takes a ddec_dra pair

--> remember to set DEC in MaxIm guiding property

OK, I have center working with pixels.  But what if I can get it in
world coordinates?  That would require a special ObsData that used
PinPoint.

Hey, I could probably squeeze that in by reading the HDUList[0].header
in the ObsData.

I can standardize on having the ObsData provide pixels for obj_center
and desired_center and do the transformations on the fly as needed.

Hmm  What if I want to pass an astrometry to center?  It can be
authoritative or approximate

Ack.  I was zealous in saving memory and deleted HDUList_im_or_fname
from ObsData.  I still want the header around, if possible.

I guess that means I want to have self.header around

OK, took care of that, hopefully without inducing bugs

Now I need to think about flow.  I have scope_wcs, which returns an
HDUList (should just be a header) that

test del withhout copy in ObsData

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22069727/python-garbage-collector-behavior-on-compound-objects

suggests I don't need to do the copy, since individual objects have
individual reference counts even if they are within a compound object

Working on ioio.py

--> enumeration of Telescope. AlignmentMode Property

--> not getting astrometry of guider right

reversing RA helped, but rates are way too high

push north button, Jupiter moves down
on east of pier, push west, Jupiter moves right

upper left resulted in dra_ddec

[ 0.15581682  0.08760853]

lower right

[-0.1570902  -0.07768477]

and that after the RA axis flip (still on ease side of pier)

KIt is almost like we are off by a factor of 2

Jupiter (star) in upper left moving -20, +34

Hmm.  Factor of 2 on guider rate did it!  Oops, that was to absolute
center of image

Oops, was using standard center!  Wow!  That worked!

ioio.py center --ObsClassName CorObsData

Works too!

Pier flip.  Jupiter is near meridian, but I should be able to track
past the meridian for a bit + I can go to Vega if worse comes to worse

Hmm.  Now it is totally not working try center again.

Moved it farther away.  But sky is super bright

Whew.  What a pain.  Lets see if we can break it down into some constituents

Actually not too bad!

Fri Jan 26 15:28:20 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Whew!  Finally got the thing to work on the east side of the pier

Sat Jan 27 05:21:04 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Works on west side of pier!

I still have the residual E/W flip I am not sure is correct.  Delta RA
is relative to what positive RA is, which is negative X in the sense
that east is left when you look at the sky and east is positive RA.
Noted that in the code.

Now that centering is working, the next step is to work on guiding,
since I think I am going to need to turn that on and off myself

CCDCamera.GuiderCalState == 2 may be a nice thing to assert to make
sure the guider is calibrated, though I am not sure if that is on a
per launch basis

Sun Jan 28 06:45:30 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

--> So I am having two problems.  The pier flip logic is not working
and CorObsData is not finding the center of Jupiter reliably

Centered nicely on Procyon while on east side of pier (looking west).
Ah, I think the problem is AstroPhysics might define east and west
differently, which continues to confuse me.  But getting run-away

So confusing thing is that PinPoint solution clearly shows flip in
both X and Y axes when doing CDELT and friends.  That reflects that
the telecsope tube is physically rotated through 180 degrees on pier
flip.  But what happens to the axes?

--> Ah, when through the pole, the sense of the DEC axis gets flipped,
    so it happens to match the flipped sense of the DEC direction on
    the CCD.  But RA doesn't.

OK, so where to implement this?

<sigh> The way I implemented this with absolute coordinates, I think I
need to do the flip in both places, since +DEC is in the wrong
direction


--> Now wait a minute.  In scope_wcs, I do the pier flip to get the
scaling astrometry correct, but I don't do it to get the pier side of
the actual observation correct

So I lined things up when pierEast was in effect, which is presumably
why that worked correctly on that side

Sun Jan 28 12:11:21 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Reading Autoguider Calibration section of MaxIm manual.  It says
calibraitons are in +/- X and +/-Y, implying that X, Y buttons are
real mount directions
GuiderAutoPierFlip when scope connected
GuiderReverseX when scope not connected

There is no property for the Pier Flip check box, though it may be
reflected in GuiderReverseX.  Documentation implies that
GuiderReverseX could re-reverse a Pier Flipped state.

From the looks of it, MaxIm is set up to just fiddle with the buttons
until it works, not have a systematic replacement of a GoTo mount interface.



  And even more confusingly, MaxIm can flip X
            # for a GEM if the appropriate check box(es) are checked.
            # And the worst yet, MaxIm does not tell us what kind of
            # mount it is connected to, since it can guide just by
            # having the camera connected to the guide buttons on the
            # mount paddle

? Guider motor control box options on Guider Settings Advanced tab
aren't anywhere in property.

--> This means that I am going to have to separately keep track of the
    guider orientation and pier flip options

So GuiderAutoPierFlip is a method that is going to deal with this.  It
will return a tuple indicating if thigns are flipped.

Ack!  My astrometry is not going to know about PIERSIDE unless it was
taken from a GoTo scope.  This is starting to be pretty impossible to
accomodate a nonGoTo scope

--> Bob says something about calibrating guider when mount is on east side

Ah, but I can use the astrometry? .... No, I don't know what state the
mount was in when it was calibrated.  Based on the pier collision last
year, it is clear that MaxIm keeps track of that, at least for "Point
telescope here"

Ah, I can tell what side the calibration was done on because I have an
absolute guider calibration and the angle

So guider calibration is done +X, -X, +Y, -Y

Right now, the calibration is (+3.407, -3.384) at -178.4 deg

I know the
CD1_1   =   1.16034386481E-003
CD2_2   =   1.18245542821E-003
PIERSIDE= 'WEST    '

I guess what I want is a method that takes the guide_astormetry and
CCDCamera.Guider* info and returns ra rates and pier side on which

I might want to make my guider dictionary a separate object.  [No,
just make it part of the object, filled after connect]

O = CorObsData('/data/io/IoIO/raw/2018-01-28/R-band_off_ND_filter.fit', plot_dprof=True, plot_ND_edges=True)

suspect it is because there is too much flux on ND filter

Got errors out, but Y reversed

CRVAL2 is wrong [fixed]

Sensing a circular argument with guider_cal_pier_side [nope]

number of significant pixels 9457074.77866 = 9E6

Well, after all that, Jupiter is going in the wrong direction

So my flip state is depending on the guider astrometry file, which it
should not

Guider west:
Guider X is +
dp = 120,135
sides = 0, 0
flip state 1 1

Guider east
dp = -117, -138
sides = 0 1
flip state = -1 1

Fixed problem with west because was doing product, when both change
(always results in 1) and checking for pier_flip as boolean, not == 1

But now I am still going in the wrong direction

--> Check that guider cal changes numbers with changed sides.  Was
    calibrated on side 1 = west.  I am on east now.  Numbers are 
    search back on "Right now, the calibration is"

West side, the calibration was (+3.407, -3.384) at -178.4 deg
East side, the calibration is  (+3.405, -3.205) at 0.825 deg

plus x went to the right, plus Y went up

So indeed, the calibration depends on the pier side
Calculated RA rate is now the second of these
(0.004178075, 0.0050202733987532609).

Am I forgetting cos DEC?  Yes.  That makes the calculated RA rate
closer.

Now that I am calibrated on the east and doing astrometry on the east,
my pier flip state is 1 1, suggesting that this should work!  Indeed,
got there on the first try!  Then proceeded to get lost since I am not
doing CorObsData, but the directions are correct.

Review: calibrate with scope on west, (looking east), got pier flip
state wrong on west side of meridian (scope on east looking west)
ASSUMING that MaxIm keeps track of what side it was calibrated on.

Hmm.  There is another thing going on here.  The rates are the same
sign but the angle is different.  Well, I think that means MaxIm did
the conversion into pixel coordinates from motion, like I expected it did.

Hmm.  Maybe it is wrong to not take the angle into consideration when
doing the pier side?  No, I am getting the right answer there.

All signs are pointing to MaxIm calling east of pier, looking west,
"flipped"

OK, another thing I have to look at: what does MaxIm really mean by X
and Y?  Fundamentally there are RA and DEC motors.  X and Y are what
line up along those 

Ack!  I am still getting it wrong!

What if I simplified it

I have a take_im for the main camera.  That does CCDCamera.Expose()
--> consider making it also do guider optionally

now I want to do a center with guider.  But at the MaxIm level, this
is move_with_guide_box

Thinking about expanding scope_wcs to include delta pixels and/or RE/DEC

--> how is move_with_guide_box going to be called?  Do I need to
    calculate dra*cos(dec), or is that going to be in it already?
    Ultimately, I am going to have a dpix from the main imager

Hey, I can completely reuse the PrecisionGuide center logic for
center_with_guider

Might consider putting it into center_loop too

ioio.py center --ObsClassName CorObsData
ioio.py guide
ioio.py center --ObsClassName CorObsData

guider.exptime is not defined unless we start the guider

Might want to have an occational message that I am moving with the

Moved guide box to 296, 244.8 and counting, but main image hasn't
moved a bit

--> read time for guider

Might have been offset file causing the problem

--> Autoguider image on top & gave array error.  Think of way to make
    sure correct docuiment is selected

Am I going to have to stop the guider to change the coordinate?
Indeed.  <sigh>  So this is not going to work as advertised, or I
am doing it wrong

Advertised move while tracking, but it is not doing that

NO!  The problem was I was using GuiderSetStarPosition instead of
GuiderMoveStar

No, I *was* using GuiderMoveStar.

OK, so there are a couple of things here that look like show
stoppers. (1) GuiderMoveStar doesn't and (2) the Documents system is
messed up

(2) --> Might be able to take care of with DOcument next and checking
for document name of Autoguider Image


Work more with GuiderMoveStar

OK, simple case worked

Definitely going up when should go down.  Might even be 90 

--> my start guider doesn't seem to be getting the right star.
    Because I need to set CCDCamera.GuiderAutoSelectStar.  It doesn't
    read it from a dialog box

Direction is totally messed up!  Depends on where I am on CCD?

Guider stuff might matter some, but still, the pixel calculation seems
totally off

In the lower right, seems to go totally wrong direction with +

Try my tracking again.  398, 292 is what it came up with even after I
set it to something else.  But it was sort of close.


lower right got  +44, +45, which was in the right direction
lower left gets +47 -51 flip signs (or transpose)
upper left  -13, -41 transpose

Correct transpose (I think)
upper left 47, 33 (wrong way)
upper right -41.93768271  21.16033724

Where the upper right is definitely closer to the X axis.
So I think that means I have a minus sign

upper right very low 56 -8

Next up is getting the guiding to be a little more gentle in an
intelligent way.  But that is not absolutely necessary right now

Need to work with Document object more in MaxIm

I really need to work with the Documents collection, not CurrentDocument

Mon Feb 05 03:39:07 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Worked!

So now I need to give myself a series of exposures.  My original plan
was to use events for this at the MaxIm level.


Looks like I need to start with CCDCamera.EventMask.  Notify event is
what I look at, I guess

Ah, the events is how I could have done the guider stuff

--> have to set EventMask first

ceExposureCompleted

is what I want

So how do I handle events in Python?


Threading might be a way to talk between my 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html

But MaxIm says I can use events just to avoid polling, which sounds
like am optimization I can skip for now

--> RMS coming back to fast on first guide
Ah, might be before first exposure, so no error

Mon Feb 05 14:10:19 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Notify event is confusing.  Trying to figure it out.  I get that I
have to set the Mask Bit value

ioio.py MaxImCollector

Hmm.  Events are a little tougher

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33208969/how-to-pass-arguments-to-win32com-event-handler

But try simple case to see if it works

https://vlasenkov.blogspot.ru/2017/03/python-win32com-multithreading.html

Hmm.
http://docs.activestate.com/activepython/3.4/pywin32/html/com/win32com/HTML/QuickStartClientCom.html

This is getting quite complicated.

All this to avoid generating some filename.

So I can try this out with acquire_image and just feeding it images

GuideBoxAdjuster is what I need to work on now.

--> I can run it with a bunch of files to see what I come up with

Note that arcsec/hour is a more common thing than guider pix per 10s.
I am at

0.020*4.42/10*3600
31.824

That is a sizable drift.

Tue Feb 06 05:02:43 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

So we now have a list of times and dra_ddec.

--> was thinking about separately controlling position vs nearness to
    desired center, but stay simple for now.

Hey, wait!  The delta of dra_ddec is my literal motion that I was
thinking about separately controlling!  The instantanous dra_ddec gets
factored in there if I want

So do we want one guide box rate?  Ultimately, the guidebox will be
moved at a particular rate for a particular amount of time & then
that will change.  So we will need a history to match up with our
object movements.  But some of guidebox motion may be due to 

So we really have two things, the guide box motion due to differential
flexure and guide box motion due to non-siderial guiding with a star.
Right now, we are taking care of the former, which is just one
component of the total.

Current design has me writing this to a file & reading it with the
GuideBoxMover

I can use list.insert(0, element) to insert an element at the
beginning, if I want to do that

Or I can just do things in regular order and then reverse.  But the
point is that we derive a new rate just by subtracting the measurement
movement from the current movement

OK, decide to stay in regular order.  Also figured out why image of
Jupiter moves and not ND filter.  The field lens focuses the pupil of
the telescope onto the camera lens.  When it moves/tips (which is
equivalent to tiping the filter), the pupil moves, moving the apparent
image of everything in the focal plane.  The ND filter is not imaged
by the field lens onto the camera lens.  It is close enough to
basically be part of it.  So movement of the field lens does not
effect its apparent position in the focal plane.

The upshot of this is that I really do need to keep track of the
position of Jupiter for each filter.  I can build up a list of
observed filters and dt and dra_ddec for each filter.  What data
structure is best for that?

Ultimately I want the filters to be in a list.  If I keep the same
enumeration, I might be able to have a list of 

Ah, I can use the index() method of the list and so have a parallel
list of lists.

What I would like would be a way to have dictionary...  No, figured
out how to have a list comprehension grep it out for me

--> now is when I need delta=True in scope_coords.  No, I actually may
    not need w_coords in ObsData

--> self.ObsDataList needs to be cleared when I restart the guider

Hmm.  I have the logic down for stopping the motion of the object, but
what do I do with the center?  Previously, I moved it during an
exposure using a typical exposure length and the amount I wanted to
move it.  Now I am wondering if the right thing to do is a
move_with_guider.

--> Do the move_with_guider and keep track of those deltas in
    guide_box_flex_rates (or whatever I want to call it)

Wed Feb 07 05:10:09 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

ioio.py from command line is now back to killing the camera when it
exits.  This makes sense in a way, since we

Somehow CCDCamera.LinkEnabled is being set to False when the object is killed.

--> Consider handling it with a __del__ method? or with atexit?

Or maybe I need to set it to False instead of violently exiting?

Neither seems to work

!! after disconnection and reconnecting FocusMax, seems to work OK
--> That seems to be repeatable, but double-check all failure modes

DATE-OBS is the start of the exposure

So we can do the midpoint again.

Hmm.  We have a phasing problem.

An observation was taken before we knew about it.  We can potentially
initialize our rates on first entry to 0.  The point is that we start
an obs_center_rate a the beginning of an exposure (technically when we
get our first response from GuideBoxMover).  The measurement of the
center is done at the midpoint of the exposure.  At the end of the
exposure, we calculate the rate for the next image.

Lets think about the GuideBoxCommander for a minute.  Right now it
does the subprocess opening.  That might be something I'd rather do in
the __init__ method, with __del__ doing the p.terminate (though I am
not sure if this is necesesary)

I could have the units be in the same as HORIZONS    Units: ARCSECONDS PER HOUR

So basically, I am ready to put the guide box rates into the
PrecisionGuide object

The more I think about it, the more I want to put every thing I need
for PrecisionGuide into the ObsData

Wed Feb 07 14:44:44 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Making progress.  I have logic that will hopefully null out motion and
have the Jupiter images cluster around the desired_center.

--> Check if on-off subtraction works OK this way.  May need to keep
    track of filter positions relative to each other and move them
    into the center

--> consider making desired_center a little to the left of center

Thu Feb 08 05:43:48 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Wrote to the end of PrecisionGuide for now.  Now all I need to do is
test it.  Critical Juno time right now

On telescope tab, MaxIm reports "Pier flip" when scope is west of
pier looking east.  This is opposite of what I assumed and means
my initial east = -X was correct and my argument for what pier flip
means was incorrect

Changed sense of MaxImPierFlip and made -X = east + center still works
(which uses guider_move)

Next up is testing PrecisionGuide

I basically need something like this: <start to write data_collector>

Back to logic of data_collector.  Ultmately, I am looking for one
routine, I am currently calling it acquire_image, which checks to see
if the closed-loop system is running, does the initial centering,
turns on guider, takes and analyses the 

--> Need a section of PrecisionGuide namespace for initial

    and turning the system on

!!! Hey, since I am taking the data rather than passively swatching it
    go by, I can enforce a uniform filter for centering !!!

--> Add a filter selection logic and filter delay

Wondering if it might be wise to have a self.lastO in precision guide
so that I can effectively have a global return value from center_loop
et al. when I need it.  Either that or I have something in ObsData
that says that it was centered and to what tolerance!  No.

See IoIO.notebk.  Consider some measurement error estimates to help
the process along.  Maybe just let it slide, measuring the rate and
nulling that + only making a correction when we are beyond a certain
threshold from the center or after the dispersion on our current
location is low enough to be confident that our rates are good enough
to reset their measurment after a one-time move

Sat Feb 10 16:13:45 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Thinking more about errors and using them to trigger a correction.
What I see when I do this myself is Jupiter moving a noticeable amount
and then I apply a one-time correction to the rate, recenter and start
over.

Sources of error:

. Ability to determine the center of the object.  Without a
sophisticated algorithm, I can just estimate that at 1 pixel for now

. Seeing.  If I have a short exposure compared to seeing motion time,
I can be off by that amount.  Seeing is the spread in a long-term
exposure assuming good guiding.  Seeing can also be related to the
dispersion in the guider, assuming good tracking, though if the guider
exposure is long, that will average out.

. Guide box not in right place.  The is realted to the average error.
I currently calculate RMS and have that be less than a critical value
in order to minimize the average error

Seeing and the center error add in quadrature, at least for exposures
short compared to seeing motion.  Seeing variation can be up to 100
Hz, but consider 1s as a reasonable limit

--> I should separate things out so that run calc_pix_rate does just
    that + doesn't run the GuideBoxCommander so that I can potentially
    take its intermediate output on a list of files.

Sat Feb 10 20:26:15 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Need to come up with a formula that gets seeing error.  For large
exposure time seeing error -> 0.  For times < 1s (or whatever I decide
is the threshold, seeing starts to be important

2/(1 + exptime)

Can express seeing exposure time in terms of a frequency.  See code

I also want to have some sort of weight based on the length of time
between exposures, but maybe that will come out when I look at the
whole graph.

No, I want something for time ago so that really old data don't mess
things up.  But I am not able to come up with that just yet.  Keep it
simple for now and include all data

OK, I got myself a rate from the polyfit.  Now how do I use it!  If I
apply it right away, I do a rate change.  So I need to see if
this_rate is significantly different than the previous one.
Ultimately it is about motion.  I am building up a set of average
exposure times, so I can talk about motion in one exposure.  I also
have my desired_center_tolerance.  I also have the total amount of
time I have been observing.

I think time since last rate change might be best self.current_flex_pix_TStart

ioio.py data_collector --ObsClassName CorObsData

Seems to be working smoothly doing nothing when Sirius is just past
meridian.  Make it busy!

10 -0.100 +0.200

Seems to be working at moving the total pixels at new rate numbers
relative to previous!

Well, I have a measurable shift, but didn't start the rate change soon
enough.  self.center_tolerance would be a good metric!

--> I have too many center tolerances.  Sort these out

So there is the deadband I have tolerance for when I am centering by
guider slews or guider moves

--> I might need to check for small duration moves?

Was going up and to the right

--> need a try around polyfit since it failed occasionally

There is a weird loop going on that I don't understand with the guider
<sigh> another logic error: need to keep long guide box slew logic in
center, not in move_with_guide_box


Sun Feb 11 05:25:43 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

--> Might think about another figure of merit for slope determination

Sun Feb 11 12:42:21 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Taking a minute to look at my logic.  acquire_image now acquires the
image, no matter what, but warns if not guiding or precision guiding.
Hmm.  It also shoves the image thorugh the system no matter what,
which I may want to avoid voluntarily

--> restructure logic

make delta pix threshold from actual motion, 3*error

As written calc_flex_pix_rate is more like "adjust rate and center."
But I am still determining if I wnat to try to use the guider rate to
move the image back to the center

Focused on Vega

Multiple instances of GuideBoxMover got started because it takes a
while for that to happen

play with log file on /cygdrive/c/Users/PLANETARY SCIENCE/.astropy/config/astropy.cfg

--> think about reading command file on first entry to calc_... to get
    the rate from the previous run 

05:47:53   Position = 38785  Mean HFD =  4.57
05:47:53   Temperature = 11.44

Initial try left Sirius wandering off. Try -1.8 aggressiveness on off
chance sign flip is the problem

Seems to be much happier!

After restart, which used the old rate, motion semed to be less, but
since it is based on motion, not position, and it keeps zeroing the
list, it still wanders off.  What is the best way to proceed?

If I add in motion based on delta from center, that motion would be
canceled out by my motion logic

--> Not sure if GuideBoxMover should be checking for guider settling,
    since that delays it + makes it unstable

So the main question I have about guiding by error from the center is:
what do I use for a rate?  MaxIm moves the telescope, so it doesn't
matter how long it takes to get there.  I could use the maximum
exposure again, but that might be too slow.

Maybe I could have some logic that would test which direction I am
going.  If toward the center, then I don't mess with that rate

Alternately, we can look at where it is now and where we want it to be
+ the amount of time we have been going and use that to establish a rate

How 'bout we consider a simple error based on our measurement that
goes at a rate that is weighted

dpix from desired_center/dt(longest exp)

That is not working.  Though the rate is increasing, it is just going
to lsow it down, not reverse it.

So I need both a component to measure the rate, which I have + a
component to do the recentering, which I don't.  If I kept track of
the recenting rate separately, I could take it out of the motion rate
when measuring the motion rate.  This is realted to what I was doing
before but possibly not as floppy

Before I do that, try a very short longest exposure (10s)

That is working a little better, actually a lot bettter!  But still
error based, with the target up and to the right.  I'll take it,
though, since the motion is so exaggerated

But I think I am confused as to sign.  What worked for sign here is
having dra_ddec_rate in GuideBoxCommander come straight from pix_rate,
no minus sign for what I though I needed to do for star motion on
guide camera.  But I was also sending it -dpix/10, where dpix was
obj_center - desired_center.  That is the actual motion I want it to
do.  That is right because I take out the guide box opposite motion in
move_with_guide_box.

So this means I have a sign flip in my motion code.  Hmm.  Not seeing
it.  slopes are dpix/dt.  Ah, but dpix in this sense is the
progression of obj_centers, not necessarily relative to
desired_center.  But still, it is the motion we want to null

Motion converged to 
2018-02-12T07:49:08.519(UTC) [2807.0785188547225, -1129.790736587323]

Best I got to with old code was:

2018-02-12T06:15:32.428(UTC) [225.10602712837584, -1027.4851575469136]

But it was unstable and had the minus sign

10 -0.100 +0.200
--> putting back to Jupiter setting
np.asarray((-0.100, +0.200))*(3600*4.22)/10
array([-151.92,  303.84])

Not even close to a real measurement and may suggest I have a
transpose somewhere.  dpix = O.obj_center - O.desired_center should
all be in proper transpose space

Well, the error method works on a single filter, but I am still not
sure about what to use for the denominator.  I guess the average time
between exposures might work.

Ah.  The center error method converges to something that is based on
its error from the center.  If it stuck in a different place it might
be a different value?

np.asarray([-1129.790736587323, 2807.0785188547225]) / (np.asarray((-0.100, +0.200))*(3600*4.22)/10)
array([ 7.43674787,  9.23867338])

So that assumes there is a transpose somewhere + I get close to the
factor of 10 I was using?...

Well, go back to the rate, since ultimately that gave something closer
to the right absolute number, though Jupiter didn't stick quite the
way I wanted it to.

So I have a way of measuring the rate that is reasonable.  I can also
add a component of center correction that I can take out when I
calculate the rate, or something like that.

I wonder if I could use the 

... ! Hey, I think I neglected to put in the previous rate when
calculating the new rate on my flex_rate calculations.  So a
combination of my logic might work

Mon Feb 12 08:24:01 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Consider having a routine that checks if new rates are significant

Mon Feb 12 17:23:57 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Working on weights for fitting.  The obvious is 1/obj_center_errs, but
I also wanted to include time and number of rate change transitions.
Rate change transitions 

Rate changes are easy because they can be integer multiples.  Time
could be expressed in exposure number the same way, or by a
realtionship to the average deltaT

Tue Feb 13 04:43:38 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

When we (re)center on a target, we are doing some slews that make the
center come to a different place, which would mess up the sequence of
obs_data.  So we should delete that.  There should be a single routine
that handles this

does **kwargs complain when there are extra args?  Yes.  But I can
solve my underlying problem by preparing a MaxImData separately

So when I am looking at an object, I want to keep adding to
ObjDataList.  When I go to a new object or reset the telescope, the
ObsDataList will likely become obselete, since it deals in the
absolute pixel location.  The current_flex_pix_rate and GuideBoxMover,
however, need not necessarily change if I am in the same general
location on the sky.

So reinitialize could have an option to keep the current_flex_pix_rate
but not the current_centering_rate.

So I could have an option in center to turn off the recentering rate.
Turning off the centering rate should be a separate thing, like maybe
with a property method.

Maybe what I need is a property setter/getter system for
flex_pix_rate.  I could potentially have a dictionary filled with
items

Wed Feb 14 10:34:31 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Actually, a dictionary of dictionaries might be good to pass to
GuideBoxMover so that I can pass parameters to the routines that are
doing the tweaking of the individual compoenents of the total
flex_pix_rate.  But if they tweak them with a time constant, that
information own't be recorded back to the flex_pix_ratein the main
routine unless I run those calculations in parallel.  Plus that
defeats the ObsDataList model I have been using, since the time
changes could be in the middle of an exposure.  But that is not the
end of the world, since ultimately, I am just looking for the total
amount the guide box moved in pixels.

--> Do it the simple way first + if it works, figure out the best way
    forward.  Might eventually go for an event loop or something like that.

Something funny is going on with the effective_obj_centers.
Backward/forward?

Ack!  It is time.  Trying to get the bleeding edge time at which the
guidebox starts to move, I set the time to Time.now(), which is way
out of sync with the files I am reading!

So when do I want to have the effective rate change be for off-line
processing?  I guess the shutter time of the current file

I wonder if the problem is that the centering is fighting the motion 

Fri Feb 23 04:30:56 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

Well, in the wild, my algorithm totally did not work.

I need to go back to the drawing board about how to handle centering
with multiple filters.

I guess I need to keep track of which filter is which in the centering
calculations as well and not make a move until I have multiple ones

Sat Feb 24 08:35:27 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

When I changed the code the other day to take out the D.says I also
broke the motion calculations?  No, there is still a motion rate, but
I think it is induced from the centering rate

Sat Feb 24 21:18:37 2018 EST  jpmorgen@snipe

This migth be a good night to debug this, since my logic looks like it
"should" work.  The real problem seems to have been that when I pushed
the buttons, the telescope moved in the opposite direction, suggesting
I never needed my pier flip logic in the first place.

Well, I didn't have the pier flip box checked, yet the scope was in
pier flip mode.  I told the guider to go + in RA and it went the wrong
direction.  When I asked it to go + while the scope was connected, it
went in the right direction (to the ri ght on the image).

--> Looks like I might simply have to insist that the user not check
    the Pier Flip box

So I will need to apply the scope flip for MaxIm to guide properly

That sort of worked, but new centering logic did not.

I have 4 levels here.  The initial IPT_Na_R, which calls center_loop,
which calls center for the first time, which calls guider_move, then
returns to IPT_Na_r, which starts the guider and recenters with
guidebox moves which are ultimately done in move_with_guide_box.  It
is only move_with_guide_box that knows that there are too many steps,
but it is only in center_loop that I take a picture to get the
recentering that I want.

Fri Jun 15 13:36:35 2018 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

thinking with Daniel about how to break up ioio.py since with these
new analysis modules, things are going to get complicated.

Doing a test with define.py which suggests that when you do

from define import wait

the entire module is read in.  Reading
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3162810/stop-evaluation-within-a-module
gives me the idea of breaking things up into more modules.

PrecisionGuide needs to have ObsData as an object.  When I use ObsData
in reduction code, it should be

from PrecisionGuide import ObsData

The problem with that is the win32 stuff.  But wait a minute.  Is
MaxImData the only thing that uses the win32?  YES!  But
PrecisionGuide uses MaxIm data, so we are back to square 1

Ah, but maybe I can use an exception.

Tue Jun 19 11:26:47 2018 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

Indeed, exception works!

Rearranged some things so I can start to import things on snipe for
reduction and analysis that don't get in the way of PrecisionGuide on
IoIO1U1

I would like to think about what to do with raw_data_root, since I am
now using it in three places.

Revisiting the wisdom of having MaxImData separate.  It is really part
of PrecisionGuide, just like ObsData.  Someone could use it
separately, but that is just a from PrecisionGuide import MaxImData.
The point is PrecisionGuide could have a chooser which for now is just
hard-coded stuff.  Right now the names are in
PrecisionGuide.raw_data_root, etc.  If I do a real ASCOM chooser, that
will depend on win32com.client, I think.  But that is only for the
ASCOM stuff.  raw_data_root has two purposes.  Storage of astrometry,
which could be in the same Windows directory that chooser stuff is
stored.  And then the general stuff for data storage, which could
eventually be split out, which I essentially do.

So the question is, do I need an object to do all of this or are
properties OK.  Go with the property for now.  Objects can set
property

Here is an idea for making a movie

http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/11/29/data-animations-with-python-and-moviepy/

So that suggests I have make_frame (or whatever the "iterator") would
be somewhere that has access to all of the reduced images.  I make a
VideoClip object (e.g. animation) and then write it in whatever format
I want.

The flow would be for me to reduce things to FITS files first, since
that is likely to take a while.  Then the thing would be how to best
display and 

Matplotlib has animation, but blog claims moviepy is better

numpy arrays go directly to MoviePy.  See jpm_fns for scaling, which
is really good news!  I do it in the np array

So for doing the animation, I don't really need objects, I just need
some code segments.  For doing the collapsing, as well, I don't see
the need for an object right now.  Though I could potentially do the
reduction like a cache.  If it recognizes a file, it would read that
for collapse, movie making, or whatever

I would need to have some sort of /redo, which could be keyed to the
reduction level automatically!

So the real thing I am making is the iterator function that is going
to return the movie frame or collapsed thing (which might eventually
get written as a FITS extension or companion file).  But maybe I only
want part of that.  As in the make_frame would be something that
called the read/reduction code.

Hmm.  That is a nice idea, but I won't necessarily know the name of
the reduced file + there are decisions during reduction to limit bad
ones....

I want to be able to flip the images properly, but maybe first make
the movie, since one frame of that gives me the proper orientation
compared to Nick's image

pip3 install moviepy

OK, when PIERSIDE = 'WEST' things seem to match Nick's picture, but
that doens't make it right

Indeed, the astrometry suggests Y is flipped

In order to do parallel, I am looking at

https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool

So I have the iterable as the directory name, or if I do this at the
individual directory level, the file name.  But I have a bunch of
other arguments to pass.  That seems to be what the initializer and
initargs does

class multiprocessing.pool.Pool([processes[, initializer[, initargs[, maxtasksperchild[, context]]]]])

So initializer is going to be something that returns something into
the process, where the process...  No

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10117073/how-to-use-initializer-to-set-up-my-multiprocess-pool

suggests that initializer and args are something that float in global
namespace?

This is getting me toward a CCDData which has uncertainty, but I won't

would want to cosmic ray remove, etc.

OK, so my design might need to change a little bit because I was

Ah.  The problem is file order vs time order.  Did a

on reduction, but I don't think it matters since that is all
asynchronous anyway.

atv, 'Na_on-band_007r.fits

Looks like there is a lump in the middle as expected.  Away from
center, vector is zero.  Corners are <0 suggesting off-band
over-subtraction from bias or something

Hmm.  Might need to do real bias subtraction because it looks like the
BACKSUB picked up the background level of the whole image, not the
off-image corners like I had hoped

im = readfits('Dark-S001-R030-C001-B1.fts')
median(im)
       1655.0000

so that is 21/1000 # c/s/pix dark current

0.021

atv, 'Bias-S001-R276-C001-B1.fts
-20C  1635

im = readfits('Bias-S001-R276-C001-B1.fts')

1000s dark
im = readfits('Dark-S001-R036-C001-B1.fts')
median(im)
       1652.0000

Not much different?

1s dark
im = readfits('Dark-S001-R031-C001-B1.fts')
median(im)
       1631.0000

So there really is dark current.  Doesn't change much between sensor
measured T -15 and -20C

Supposed to be 0.003e-/s at -10C

Gain is 0.3e-/ADU

0.021 *.3
0.0063

So it is a factor of 2 high

Could be high because of cosmic ray hits?  No, checked with 
im = readfits('Dark-S001-R030-C001-B1.fts')
imm = median(im, 3)
median(imm)

for a bias
stddev(im)
       15.475665

Readnoise should be < 5

stddev(im) * 0.3
       4.6426997
       
So I should subtract bias and dark, which is pretty much one number

The previous was definitly over-subtracted in the corners

Fixed code to do biases + there was som oscillation in the corners
between +/-20- 20 or so, but other than that, it looks pretty good

Don't want to kill Na because of on-band background level because that
is my measurement!

atv, 'SII_on-band_007r.fits

looks nice,  compare to 

atv, '/data/io/IoIO/reduced.previous_versions/2018_MOP_version/2018-05-20/SII_on-band_007r.fits

0 scaling says they are a little different, but hard to tell

Wed Jul 25 07:34:37 2018 EDT  jpmorgen@snipe

I seem to have a time dependent difference between bias+dark and first
hist peak: 14.79574140168711 -> 1 -> -15

That is enough so that I should do better.

After a while it get as big as -28, -38, -78, -84 (still on [SII])

Consider taking a run through the [SII] images to get the real
bias/dark as a function of time and then use that for all files.

--> consider being more careful with patch of CCD used for dark.
    Chance I see might be it just getting dark

--> Long-term, make a bias_dark component that goes through and does
    the study and informs final bias_dark subtraction

Thinking of making a file with both Na and [SII] in it with the
photometry from various apertures.  The [SII] would be a control.
Keep in mind I am doing this asyncronously, so I will eventually need
to sort the file.

Looks like PDS4 wants CSV files.  There is a csv module in Python....

import csv

    csvw = csv.writer(csvfile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
    csvw.writerow(['FNAME'] + ['LINE'] + ['TMID'] + ['EXPTIME'] + ['TOTAL'] + ['AP_WHOLE'] + ['AP_STRIP_300'])
with open('ap_sum.csv', 'a', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvw = csv.writer(csvfile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
    csvw.writerow(['asd'] + ['Na'] + ['1998-02-03T00:00'] + [1234] + [123])

with open('ap_sum.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvr = csv.reader(csvfile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
    for row in csvr:
        print(row)

The alternative is dictionary, which is a little prettier maybe

    csvr = csv.DictReader(csvfile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
    for row in csvr:
        print(row)

Prints None for things I haven't defined yet.  Looks like DictReader is nicer.

But what I really want is something that gives me the rows in some way
like a database

import csv
dlist = []
with open('ap_sum.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvr = csv.DictReader(csvfile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
    for row in csvr:
        dlist.append(row)

print(dlist[0]['TMID'])

Tlist = [dlist[i]['TMID'] for i in range(len(dlist))]

Tlist = [row['TMID'] for row in dlist]

np.argsort(Tlist)


dlist[0].keys()

import csv
with open('ap_sum_dict.csv', 'a', newline='') as csvfile:
    csvw = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, dlist[0].keys(), quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
    csvw.writeheader()
    for row in dlist:
        csvw.writerow(row)

This puts the keys out of order.  It might be nice to define the keys
first.  Also will need to check if overwrite, file has been written
for header, all that stuff.

OK, where do we put the writeheader?  Best in reduce_pair if I can get
the logic right.

reduce_pair doesn't know about other things that have run before.  So
I should probably have ReduceDir delete the ap_sum (or whatever) file
if it is going to recalculate a directory.  Then I check to see if the
file exists on each call to reduce_pair, so I can make sure to start
the file with the header.  After the directory has been processed,
then I want to go back and look at the file.  This can be done in the
same way do the movie tree, I suppose.

No, the problem on [SII] seems to be a general below zero

ReduceCorObs.py reduce --recalculate /data/io/IoIO/raw/2018-05-20/SII_on-band_007.fits /data/io/IoIO/raw/2018-05-20/SII_off-band_007.fits

On-band difference between bias+dark and first hist peak:  1.7966763942929447      
Off-band difference between bias+dark and first hist peak:  -2.240000000000009  

That is pretty good so it is presumably not

atv, '/data/io/IoIO/raw/2018-05-20/SII_off-band_007.fits

There is definitly an edge from scattered light that can presumably be
found by the first peak algorithm.

But even after that is found to fairly high precision there is still
this residual background.  For the [SII], this is relatively easy to
deal with since we expect 0 and can set it to 0 by making the
assumption we are seeing some sort of atmospheric emission in the
off-band filter at the ~50R level.  This makes some sense because it
is uniform across the field, not patterned after the scattered light

OK, that potentially explains why [SII] is such a large negative sum.

How can we make sure Na is OK?  I expect there to be earth atmospheric
Na, which would make a pedestal.  The question is: do I have a large
enough FOV to measure that.  Looking at Wilson et al 2002, 10Rj up or
down is still 50 R or so from the intrinsic nebula.  I am getting an
average of 57R

Rj = np.asarray((50.1, 29.8))/2. # arcsec
plate = 1.59/2 # main "/pix
(2627-1467) * plate / Rj
array([36.81437126, 61.89261745])

So I do go up.down more than Wilson.

im = readfits('/data/io/IoIO/reduced/2018-05-20/Na_on-band_007r.fits')
plot, im[1522, *], /ylog, yrange=[1, 10000]

Looks like residual might be 30 at an edge

plot, im[1522, *] - 30, /ylog, yrange=[10, 1000]

Fiddling with things convinces me I probably have a constant
background issue in both the [SII] (off-band) and Na (on-band)

I am also seeing the best way to present this is by average pixel
value, so I need to do some pixel counting

Consider doing edge masking from both on- and off-band images

--> Note that the interpolate shift and rotate mess up the perfect 0
    values at the edges of the ND filter

--> note on this day the movie is messed up because it looks like the
    center of Jupiter is messed up by the passage of a moon

May be because I assume center of Jupiter is perfect?

! Leave it a mystery for now

Looking at aperture sums in Excel.  All apertures track each other.
They all get brighter starting around 8UT.  That seems to be a linear
trend on top of whatever downturn has happening before.  Last point is low

second time equals first!  Seems to be my copying somehow

A case could be made that there is a bump in the total aperture,
presumably from Io.  There is less of that in the other data, but
still a plateau.

So I think I am ready to run this on everything.  I will need to make
a routine that reads all the files like movie does, but that is what
is up.

Well, I can look at the [SII] distribution and find that away from the
IPT, there is no evidence of increase in light.

Worry about temperature sensitivity of off-axis response.  Plot total
and it really doesn't make much difference.

Interestingly, just the central part peaks later.

Wait a minute.  The way I have done the subtraction with medians, the
surface brightness in the center is much less bright than I
expect....  Ahh.  I am subtracting the surface brightnesses without
taking into consideration the area...

But the reason I was checking the middle area inside of 300 pixels was
to see if the effect went away, since I would expect the wavelength
shift to not be so close to the edge of the bandpass.  That didn't
seem to be the problem

--> Oops, I think I need to fix my background to include off-band
    images as well, since the exposure time and thus dark current will
    be different

    It seems like ASCOM has things backward from Astro-Physics and
    Dean's preference.  His preference is to have north up when the
    mount is on the west looking east.  I didn't necessarily think of
    it that way, I just pressed north on the AP ASCOM driver and
    assumed that was north.  But that is only north when the mount is
    on the west looking east

Off_0 increases to the later dates just like I would expect!  It also

March 2018 is peak

Opposition was May 8-9.

Expecting minimum distance of light travel to be the way to get light
into the telecsope, I would expect the peak to be after opposition

Looking at night individually and many nights in May are clumpy around
a median with some high values at beginning and end.

Late ooposition swoppy to end of night

May is about even

April there is more spread

March 15 is a swoop plus plateau that looks like it could be from

Reading Carl's email, he says that mesospheric Na emission is 100 -- 200R

That is right in the range that the full-field aperture sum shows, at
peak time.

Assuming this, I want to take a smaller aperture, maybe above and
below for background, and then ones out to the side that would be
dominated by the Jovian Na.
